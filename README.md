## Getting started
Currently in the works...

## API
http://www.alojs.com/docs/api/ Currently in the works!

## Versions
There are different main files available for use in the [main](https://github.com/alojs/alo/tree/master/main) folder.

The files are constructed with a combination of these postfixes:

* full: includes extras (helpers like some basic reducers and middleware)
* dev: enables long stacktraces in promises and will (as of 3.0) add the debug console to the Alo class

## CDN's
You can use Alo with NPM or Bower or even straight from a CDN. There are couple browser builds available in the dist folder

### Development (unminified and with devtools) (see <a href="#versions">Versions</a>)

* Core: https://cdn.rawgit.com/alojs/alo/v2.3.0/dist/alo.dev.js
* Full: https://cdn.rawgit.com/alojs/alo/v2.3.0/dist/alo.full.dev.js

### Production (minified)

* Core: https://cdn.rawgit.com/alojs/alo/v2.3.0/dist/alo.min.js
* Full: https://cdn.rawgit.com/alojs/alo/v2.3.0/dist/alo.full.min.js

### More?
Please have a look at [RawGit](https://rawgit.com). It allows you to use basically any file from Github repos (and therefore also all the files from https://cdn.rawgit.com/alojs/alo/v2.3.0/dist/)

## FAQ
1. *Is this library ready to use for production?*
API-wise there are not many open changes planned, however the library is quite young and I don't want to feature freeze the library yet. So if I see a huge optimization potential or get useful feedback I am open for API changes. (But even if that happens I will try to minimize the required changes for users). Then there is also just the chance to find nasty bugs as an early adopter - this chance just can't be eliminated 100%.

2. *Where is the documentation?*
I am working on it.

3. *What are your future plans?*
Trying to add examples, test the software, add more extras, work on the dev-tools. My goal is to ship an as stable as possible 3.0 in the next couple of months (End of Q1(07) / Start of Q2(07))
